My name is Harry Goodman. I am a machine learning engineer, I enjoy developing end-to-end machine learning solutions. I enjoy the oppotunity to learn new technologies and apply machine learing to 
complex problems. I have a Bachelor of Mathematics and a Bachelor of Economics from the University of Queensland. 

### Interests

I love to continue expanding my knowledge in machine learning and statistics. Particularly in deep learning, Bayesian modelling and DevOps. In my spare time, I settling shallow hypotheis' by applying machine learning to sports data. My sweet spot is leveraging AWS to create automated solutions, especially for those useless models.

Outside of work and personal projects, you'll catch me doing the exact opposite... AFL, basketball and camping.
